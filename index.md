We're a community of origami enthusiasts that hold weekly meetings to fold and discuss origami.
Club meetings are usually on Tuesdays from 5-7pm in the Student Services Center, but make sure to join our [discord](https://discord.gg/PfdyQ4X5e7) for accurate information.
All skill levels are welcome and paper will be provided, we hope to see you there!
