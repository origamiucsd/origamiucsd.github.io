We're a community of origami enthusiasts that hold weekly meetings to fold and discuss origami.
We usually meet on Fridays from 5-7pm at Sun God Lounge, but make sure to join our [discord](https://discord.gg/PfdyQ4X5e7) for accurate information.
All skill levels are welcome and paper will be provided, we hope to see you there!
