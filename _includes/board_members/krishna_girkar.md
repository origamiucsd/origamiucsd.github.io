I started folding origami when I was 5 years old by following YouTube videos.
Eventually, I learned how to read diagrams and my parents bought me _Works of Satoshi Kamiya_, which was my introduction to complex origami.
I started trying to design models a couple years ago, and is mostly simple models via free folding.
Following diagrams/crease patterns and designing serve 2 different purposes for me - the former is a way for me to productively pass the time, while the latter scratches my artistic itch to create something brand new.
I think I'm a fan of designing simple models because I'd want to make stuff that I could've folded when I was a kid, mostly using kami or printer paper and without needing much shaping.
